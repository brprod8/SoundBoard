# Getting Started
This is a space-themed soundboard designed to play various `sound effects` upon button clicks. The soundboard is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

> To use the Space Soundboard, simply click on any of the buttons to play the corresponding sound effect. 

# Design
The Space Soundboardfeatures a modern and sleek design with a dark color scheme and animated space-themed buttons. The buttons are animated to move slowly when the cursor is not hovering over them and to move faster when the cursor hovers over them. The title text is also animated with a shaking effect.


# Contributing
`Contributions` are always welcome! If you have any suggestions or ideas for improving the Space Soundboard, please feel free to submit a pull request.
